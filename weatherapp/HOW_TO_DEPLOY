1- get the code url from the version control ------------> ask the Dev team
2- as the developper for any extra specifications ---------> is there any extra specification I need to know
3- determine the number of service --------> will be coming from app presentation (powerpoint)-UI, Weather, redis, db, Auth (5 services)
4- determine the number of service develop by my company -----> check with DEV team, or look on the company url repos (UI, Weather, Auth)
5  determine the number of  third party service NOT develop by my company (redis,db)
6- make sure I have all the dockerfile for the services my compay has developed ---> yes




7- write the dockerfile for  third party service NOT develop by my company--->Write Dockerfile for Redis and DB.



8- determine with devops the deployment strategy ------------------------> docker-compose
9 - make sure all required file for the deployment strategy is available -------------yes--veryfied
10 - determine ow to manage secrets (very important) ---------> counted secret(3). secret will be managed by jenkins secret store
11- determine all deployment stages involve 
     * write the Jenkinsfile
       CODE
          * clone the code ----> setup with webhook
          * check important file if required ---->none on this project
          * build code binary if required ---->languages(go, python, node)
       CODE SCANNING
        * scan the code using sonar-scanner--->check sonar-scanner---->jenkins--------> sonarqube connection
        * report to sonarqube UI-------------------------------> sonarqube, jenkins connection
       CODE QUALITY
        * check quality gate 
             *  if the code PASS build continue  -------------> incorporate quality gate in jenkinsfilr
             *  if the code FAILS  build STOP

################# if CODE QUALITY pass #########################
       BUILD DOCKER IMAGES
            * build images usinfg docker -----------------> happen in all branches
       PUSH  DOCKER IMAGES TO DOCKERHUB
              * if the commit branch is NOT  develop
                  * DO NOT PUSH ------------------------> not a Pull request
              * if the commit branch is  develop--------if pull request
                  * PUSH to dockerhub
        ############## if the commit branch is  develop  #########################
                      * deploy the application 
                           * contruc the docker-compose/helm override values file/etc... ----------->EOF
                           * deploy to a VM/K8S  ----------------> jenkins to launch the VM
        SMOCK CHECK
            * smock check of the application after deployment  ------------> query application header
        POST BUILD 
            * notify devops team on build output  on slack --------->jenkins -->slack---->end user
            
12 - create the project Jenkins 
13 - make all required connection 
14- implement the project in jenkins
